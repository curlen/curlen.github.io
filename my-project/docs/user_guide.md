## Site interface
After logging onto AirPhoning with your email and password, you will be on the `Home` page. On the left side of the page is the main menu with links to different pages and actions within AirPhoning. 

The **Home** page shows your personal QR code that you can scan with your phone to start cold calling imported prospects. 

The **Prospecting** page where you see the data of your imported cold calling prospects, a copy of your cold calling script, and areas where you can choose a status of the prospect after making a call. If you need to set up a meeting with a prospect, you can set one up from this page.

The **Add data** page is where you can add new prospects using a CSV file. Additionally, you can add prospects manually from this page.

The **Prospects** page is a list of all your imported prospects. You can view their data, prospect status, and edit and delete prospects. 

The **Meeting** page is where you can view the details of any future meetings. You can view the details of prospects, find meeting details, and create meetings from this page.

In the top right are options to change the language of the website, make the application fullscreen, view your user profile, and log out from AirPhoning. Clicking **Profile** brings you to the **My profile** page, where you can view your account information, modify your profile information, edit your call script, and link to your Axonaut calendar.
