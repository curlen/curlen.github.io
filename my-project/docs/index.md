# Airphoning Help Resources

Airphoning is a cloud-based cold-calling application where users can import and manage prospect contacts and with the application's built-in phone integration make and analyze calls.

Read the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide if you are a new user who wants to get started on importing prospect contacts and start making calls right away.

We hope [Airphoning](https://airphoning.com/) takes the stress out of cold-calling and allow you to focus exclusively on pitching your product or service to prospective clients!
